It\nsupports sophisticated formatting of structured data.\n\nWriter satisfies IWriter, true to output via *print-fn* or nil to output\nto a string, format-in is the format control string and the remaining arguments\nare the data to be formatted.\n\nThe format control string is a string to be output with embedded 'format directives'\ndescribing how to format the various arguments passed in.\n\nIf writer is nil, cl-format returns the formatted result string. Otherwise, cl-format\nreturns nil.\n\nFor example:\n (let [results [46 38 22]]\n        (cl-format true \"There ~[are~;is~:;are~]~:* ~d result~:p: ~{~d~^, ~}~%\"\n                   (count results) results))\n\nPrints via *print-fn*:\n There are 3 results: 46, 38, 22\n\nDetailed documentation on format control strings is available in the \"Common Lisp the\nLanguage, 2nd edition\", Chapter 22
